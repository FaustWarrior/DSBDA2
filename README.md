## Group A- Data Science
**Assignment 1**

Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (e.g., data.csv)
1. Import all the required Python Libraries.
2. Locate an open source data from the web (e.g. https://www.kaggle.com). Provide a clear
description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the web site).
3. Load the Dataset into pandas data frame.
4. Data Preprocessing: check for missing values in the data using pandas insult(), describe()
function to get some initial statistics. Provide variable descriptions. Types of variables
etc. Check the dimensions of the data frame.
5. Data Formatting and Data Normalization: Summarize the types of variables by checking
the data types (i.e., character, numeric, integer, factor, and logical) of the variables in the
data set. If variables are not in the correct data type, apply proper type conversions.
6. Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python.
In addition to the codes and outputs, explain every operation that you do in the above steps and
explain everything that you do to import/read/scrape the data set.

**Assignment 2**

Create an ‚ÄúAcademic performance‚Äù dataset of students and perform the following operations
using Python.
1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies. If there are missing values
and/or inconsistencies, use any of the suitable techniques to deal with them.
2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers. If there are outliers, use any of the suitable
techniques to deal with them.
3. Apply data transformations on at least one of the variables. The purpose of this
transformation should be one of the following reasons: to change the scale for better
understanding of the variable, to convert a non-linear relation into a linear one, or to
decrease the skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution.

**Assignment 3**

Perform the following operations on any open source dataset
1. Provide summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for
a dataset with numeric variables grouped by one of the qualitative variable. 
For example, if your categorical variable is age groups and
quantitative variable is income, then provide summary statistics of income grouped by
the age groups. Create a list that contains a numeric value for each response to the
categorical variable.
2. Write a Python program to display some basic statistical details of the species of ‚ÄòIris-setosa‚Äô, ‚ÄòIris-versicolor‚Äô and ‚ÄòIris-
versicolor‚Äô of iris.csv dataset.
